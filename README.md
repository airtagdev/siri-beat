# Siri Beat
The siri beat is a world-wide meme where people do pen beats to siri saying "000000" repeatedly. Sadly, apple has patched siri being able to say this kind of calculation. The siri beat vbs file allows for you to drum to a "000000" beat with no limits, just a double click (windows compatible only).
